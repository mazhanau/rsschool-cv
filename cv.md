## Briefly about myself

Pavel Mazhanau. 39 years old.

Responsible, communicative and flexible, attentive to details. Prefer to perform one role in a project and do it well, combine several roles exhaust me quick enough. I believe that fussing doesn't help to get to the root of the problem, so I tend to think strategically. Nevertheless, in some cases, the right tactics are the only way.
